= Redis Smart Cache CLI

The Redis Smart Cache CLI is a tool for managing and configuring https://github.com/redis-field-engineering/redis-smart-cache[Redis Smart Cache].

This CLI lets you view your application's queries, analyze query performance, and select which queries you want cached.

== Installation

=== Homebrew

You can install the Redis Smart Cache CLI by running:

`brew install redis-field-engineering/tap/smart-cache-cli`

=== Download the Binaries

You can also download the Redis Smart Cache CLI binaries directly, select the https://github.com/redis-field-engineering/redis-smart-cache-cli/releases[latest release to download]. We provide builds for Linux, macOS, and Windows, across a variety of architectures.

== Usage

There are two ways to use the CLI:

1. In **interactive mode**, you can navigate the CLI's menus to observe the queries and tables being profiled by Smart Cache. You can then apply updates to the rules used to guide Smart Cache's caching decisions.
2. In **scripted mode**, you can run ad-hoc commands. This is useful when scripting interactions with Smart Cache.

=== Interactive

To run Redis Smart Cache CLI in interactive mode, execute `smart-cache-cli` with the flags needed to connect to your Redis instance. You'll then see a text-based dialog with the following options:

. List Queries
. Rule List
. Create Rule
. Table List

==== List Queries

The List Queries table shows you the queries that Smart Cache is currently tracking:

This dialog lets you choose which queries you want to create rules for. To create a pending rule for a given query, select the query you want and then press _return_.
This will open a rule dialog which will show you expanded details for the query. You can then provide a TTL, which will enable caching for this query.

==== List Rules

The List Rules dialog displays the rules currently in force for Smart Cache. You can batch the creation, editing, and deletion of rules.

==== Rule Creation

The Rule Creation dialog allows you to create and prioritize caching rules.

==== Table List

The Table List view provides you a table-level view of the profiling done by Smart Cache.

You can see your tables, their query counts, and the mean query time for all queries executed against them. You can also see whether a query is cached, including the configured TTL for any cached queries.

=== Non-Interactive Commands

The Smart Cache CLI provides several non-interactive (i.e., scriptable) commands. These include:

1. List Queries
2. Create Rules

==== List Queries

The List Queries command lists the queries seen by Smart Cache. Example:

```
smart-cache-cli list-queries
```
